## Overview of Analysis

Dana is a Data Analyst who was assigned to create a website and write a report about UFO sightings in her home town of McMinnville, Oregon. To create a website filled with UFO data, Dana will manipulate JavaScript to display the data as a table. Dana will also create filters using JavaScript to allow data exploration to be  more user friendly and efficient on the website. Finally, Dana will create an HTML page to create a pleasing visualization and secure a place to display all of the data. The purpose of this analysis is to help Dana manipulate JavaScript to add filters to her data table and create an HTML page to display all of the data with pleasing visualizations. 


## Results

After creating the JavaScript and HTML files, users can successfully filter the UFO data table to specify which data they would like to see. The filters were broken down into five categories. The five categories are date, city, state, country, and shape. Once a user enters the desired information into the filter fields, the results pop up in a table form. Users also have the option to decide which filters they would like to use to sort the UFO data. Please see the image below for a visualization of the filter fields and table.

## Summary of Analysis

Although the website successfully filters the UFO data and presents it in a table, there are some drawbacks. One drawback that could lead to a potential issue is the way the table is presented if there is no data that matches certain filters. When there is no data that matches the filters, the table presents itself as empty. This could lead the user to think that the filtering doesn't work or the website is not accurate. Instead, a message to let the user know that there wasn't a match would be much better and less confusing. 

Two recommendations that would improve the website are to implement a message pop up for when there is no data to match the filers and to add more image visualizations to make the website less overwhelming with text. I believe those two additions would make the website even more user friendly and visually appealing.
